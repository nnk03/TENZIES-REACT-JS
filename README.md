# TENZIES-REACT-JS

This is a Tenzies Game developed using React JS during the Scrimba React JS tutorial. The deployed site can be found here ([https://steady-marshmallow-d4824d.netlify.app](https://steady-marshmallow-d4824d.netlify.app))

The aim of the game is to make all the numbers on the dice same.

Some dice can be freezed so that it doesn't change its number in the subsequent rolls of the dice

When all the numbers on the dice are equal, the game ends.

This has been done with the help of React features such as React useState and React useEffect.
